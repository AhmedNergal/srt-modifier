1
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,377
Piringo.

2
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:48,008
Been looking for you.

3
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:53,387
It's the end of the road for you.

4
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,263
What's that sound?

5
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:12,868
That's the sound of
the Gion Shoja temple bells.

6
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:14,912
What?

7
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:19,075
You know, them
Heike and Genji boys.

8
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,482
On a distant island,

9
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:25,990
these two clans split into
the Reds and the Whites.

10
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:28,582
Wage war.

11
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:32,687
Sort of like that
War of the Roses, you know?

12
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:34,925
In England?

13
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,128
Who won'?

14
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,034
The Whites?

15
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:46,032
This high noon battle
was waged in Dannoura.

16
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:51,048
Hear the Heike clan in red
got themselves hog-tied

17
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,948
by the Genji clan in white.

18
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:59,582
Their story goes
a little something like this.

19
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,320
The sound

20
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:06,023
of the Gion Shoja temple bells

21
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:09,294
echoes the impermanence

22
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,096
of all things.

23
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:14,138
What bells you say'?

24
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,641
The color
of the sala flower

25
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,610
reveals the truth

26
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,307
that to flourish

27
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,280
is to fall.

28
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:35,760
The proud do not endure

29
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:39,991
like a passing dream

30
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:44,331
on a night in spring.

31
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,216
The mighty

32
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:11,057
fall at last.

33
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:15,265
See you in hell.

34
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:27,442
To be no more than
dust before the wind.

35
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,623
Piringo.

36
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,490
That's Why I love you.

37
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,986
Ain't nothing back there.

38
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,898
You ain't heard me'?

39
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:56,934
It's an ain't nothing town.

40
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:01,200
Bet you came
for the gold, too.

41
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,072
White or Red'?

42
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,770
You Genji

43
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:11,338
<i>or Hake'?</i>

44
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:26,442
Which gang's gonna buy it'?

45
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,580
My reward is one third.

46
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:36,821
If there ain't no treasure, don't pay.

47
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:41,232
Benkei, show him.

48
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:46,293
No doubt about who's
gonna be left standing.

49
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:51,536
But best not get any ideas
about playing Yojimbo.

50
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:56,979
You got to be alive to
spend your money, stranger.

51
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:17,130
The kid's got a heart,
and balls to match.

52
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,538
No! Join us!

53
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,939
We'll do better than a third!

54
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,840
We'll leave you half!

55
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,105
Half'?

56
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,778
We'll give you everything.

57
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:37,412
But with us, it's a lifetime contract.

58
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:40,615
Don't know about that.

59
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,822
I don't stay long in one place.

60
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,991
Suits us fine!

61
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:53,970
We'll give you half
for this one-time deal.

62
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,853
Not too shabby.

63
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,629
Hey, boy!

64
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:24,293
Hey. If you're
such a quick draw,

65
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,564
you don't need them.

66
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,197
Take it all.

67
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:34,335
And tell them to shove
their lifetime contract.

68
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:40,012
Boy, don't rush yourself.

69
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:45,283
Make your choice
after cooling your heels.

70
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:48,325
This town can't grow from seed,

71
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:52,796
but I can offer
some soba tea at my place.

72
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:55,196
Come with me.

73
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,699
Hey-

74
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,149
So the Reds
rode in first, eh'?

75
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:17,449
Yeah. How do you figure that'?

76
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,121
Simple.

77
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,024
With the sheriff,

78
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,621
seeing the law hitched
with the weaker side

79
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:32,067
must mean they made him
an offer he couldn't refuse.

80
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,934
Uh, of course, now,

81
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:40,467
maybe he's looking
for a chance to switch sides.

82
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,841
<i>How long has it been like this'?</i>

83
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:51,281
<i>Two months since
the Heikes Walked in.</i>

84
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,687
<i>And before that,</i>

85
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:56,693
<i>gold prospectors
started coming 'round.</i>

86
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:09,905
What?

87
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:12,465
<i>But what we couldn't
figure out was</i>

88
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:16,308
<i>why so many people,
and why now?</i>

89
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,041
The end of last month,

90
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,311
a town with the same legend

91
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:21,715
found the mother lode.

92
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:27,588
The country's gone crazy
with Heike gold tales.

93
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,592
Every nook and cranny
of every tovvn

94
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:30,922
with the treasure legend

95
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:33,293
is swarming with prospectors.

96
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:39,826
It's a genuine gold rush!
Yee-ha ha ha!

97
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:49,138
You can't touch this land,
or you'll be cursed.

98
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,202
Ha!

99
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,909
We'll take that curse
off your hands.

100
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:56,818
And we can't quietly sit by
as you lay waste to our land!

101
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:13,834
<i>In the beginning,</i>

102
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:17,568
we expected them
<i>to</i> be a godsend

103
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,770
<i>because they were Heike,
like us.</i>

104
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,982
<i>But things soon went sour.</i>

105
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:31,548
<i>The Heikes
ran off the prospectors</i>

106
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,681
<i>and started digging.</i>

107
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,360
Look!

108
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,395
What?

109
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,931
Kiyomori! Boss Kiyomori!

110
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,967
We found this.

111
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:49,166
<i>Instead of that wood marker
that read “Fear the curse“.</i>

112
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,606
I knew it!

113
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:57,307
<i>So they figured the treasure
must be somewhere,</i>

114
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:59,975
<i>and they have
been here since.</i>

115
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,769
<i>Boss Kiyomori.</i>

116
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:37,210
From today, you're one of us.

117
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:42,350
Think of it as being on vacation.

118
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:45,293
Uh, yes.

119
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,230
I've been meaning
to take some time off.

120
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,767
Feeling a little beside myself.

121
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:57,433
<i>But his reign of power
didn't last long.</i>

122
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:07,781
Dang.

123
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,253
You boys are a day late
and a dollar short.

124
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,313
This is our town.

125
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,024
Huh?

126
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,087
Ooh..

127
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,328
Dang.

128
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,327
<i>Germs.</i>

129
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:03,331
Shigemori, we got to
fatten you up, boy.

130
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,170
<i>Boss Yoshitsune.</i>

131
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,888
<i>The Genjis didn't make
a move against the Heikes.</i>

132
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:25,690
<i>They left the gold digging to them,</i>

133
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:30,928
<i>sat back, and waited
for their chance to steal the loot.</i>

134
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,239
Hey-

135
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,114
Finders keepers.

136
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:50,278
<i>After that,
people began to leave.</i>

137
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,982
<i>Just a few families are left.</i>

138
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:56,993
Ah, we might as well hire you.

139
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:01,464
But all the town can offer is this.

140
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,966
Dadacha-mame.

141
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,296
Try this.

142
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,669
Hey. Hey, welcome back.

143
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:16,546
This is my grandson.
Heihachi.

144
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,363
Give it a go.

145
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:47,743
Death isn't to be feared.

146
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:03,416
Don't Watch the blade.

147
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,621
How many times
do I have to tell you'?

148
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,028
Don't follow the blade
with your eyes.

149
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,728
Don't see it, feel it.

150
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:15,533
That's the essence
of Mononofu training.

151
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:21,674
Mononofu training
ain't samurai bullshit.

152
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:25,476
Being a samurai is
a philosophical Way of life.

153
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:30,919
But the life of Mononofu
means life of fighting!

154
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,319
If you ask me,

155
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,658
samurai are still
Wearing their skivvies.

156
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,823
They are vain.

157
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:45,198
They're still concerned
about their looks.

158
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:48,864
That's "tits on the bull" thinking.

159
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:55,574
But if you peel away that last layer

160
00:18:55,634 --> 00:19:00,105
so you are naked,

161
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:03,176
this in the raw fighting the spirit is

162
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:06,985
Warrior's lot in life.

163
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:10,356
His realm,

164
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,622
our realm

165
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:15,927
is deeper than the samuraPs.

166
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,213
Now..

167
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,218
you gonna come at me

168
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,916
or whistle Dixie?

169
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,599
What's it gonna be'?

170
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:08,304
Take this handsome man
to the Reds

171
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:12,440
or hand him over to the Whites?

172
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:15,974
You know, I'm at sea.

173
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,749
I don't know.

174
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,551
Depends on him.

175
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,367
Today's special is the Whites

176
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:35,371
with a side of
mashed potatoes and soup.

177
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,998
Forget about the Heike gang.

178
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:42,409
Their Boss Kiyomori smells
like a dead dog on a hot day.

179
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,676
He's lost so much,
he's getting dumber.

180
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:57,450
"The sound of
the Gion Shoja temple bells

181
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:04,263
echoes the impermanence
of all things."

182
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:05,800
You follow'?

183
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:10,135
Yes, I.. uh..

184
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:14,473
It means everything in this
old world changes.

185
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:19,505
It means we can never
call our services off.

186
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:23,246
We'll finally restore the glory

187
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:26,846
of our family name
and the riding-high.

188
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:30,587
Genji gang will be lead to ruins.

189
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,766
"The color of the sala flowers

190
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,771
"reveals the truth

191
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:45,570
that to flourish is to fall."

192
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,270
That's it.

193
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:51,610
It's a law of nature.

194
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,513
The Genjis are going down!

195
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,923
From today,

196
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,826
I read this.

197
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,057
What's that?

198
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,398
Shakespeare. Henry VI.

199
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,494
The War of the Roses.

200
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,439
War of the Roses?

201
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,135
Come on, boy.

202
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:22,735
Don't you know your Shakespeare'?

203
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:27,272
It's a story about
the Reds winning the war.

204
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:30,047
The Reds win'?

205
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:32,384
Yes, we'll win.

206
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:39,921
Yeah! Kiyomori!

207
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:43,927
What?

208
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,026
Kiyomori.

209
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:00,144
Don't ever call me
Kiyomori again!

210
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,648
From today..

211
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:14,955
the name's.. Henry.

212
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:24,134
Side with the Genjis.

213
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:29,202
They got a young lady,
fine as cream gravy.

214
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:32,373
That painted lady
used to be a dancer.

215
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:38,421
She's the kid's mama,
but still mighty fine.

216
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,923
Hasn't aged a bit.

217
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:45,223
A Woman of true
Genji lineage.

218
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:48,355
<i>Hés Germ and Hake'?</i>

219
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:52,425
Huh'? Oh, the kid'?

220
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:57,133
Yeah, he's a half-breed.

221
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,368
And his father?

222
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,468
Got himself killed.

223
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:19,190
You're of
the same stock, boy'?

224
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:25,600
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

225
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:45,578
He can't talk no more.

226
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:49,820
Hard to after seeing
your dad murdered.

227
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:54,161
What's his mother doing
on the Genji side'?

228
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:56,627
Ahem.

229
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:05,236
To begin with, that granny's boy
went to vvork in the city.

230
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:07,868
<i>Then, one day,</i>

231
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:12,177
<i>that boy, her son Akira,</i>

232
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:15,514
<i>[brought the Gen]! Woman home.</i>

233
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:24,385
Mama, the days of being
Genji or Heike are done with.

234
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:35,527
<i>I don't know how
or where the two met,</i>

235
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:39,371
<i>but his mother
blessed their marriage.</i>

236
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,901
<i>So Red and White got hitched,</i>

237
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:45,448
<i>and they figured
crossing roses,</i>

238
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:49,246
<i>blooming in both colors,
was romantic.</i>

239
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:02,163
<i>And they raised Heihachi,</i>

240
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,758
<i>their Red and White treasure.</i>

241
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:12,601
<i>But then the fighting
started again.</i>

242
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,242
Finders keepers.

243
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:25,346
Ugh!

244
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,316
Kiyomori!

245
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:38,424
Get out.
There ain't no gold here.

246
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,595
That's it'?

247
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:47,036
Take it all!

248
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:49,442
If you want it, take it.

249
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,105
And get out!

250
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:57,719
Daddy!

251
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,481
Heihachi!

252
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:04,186
Daddy!

253
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,244
Love hurts.

254
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,328
My favorite color.

255
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,034
Looks good on you.

256
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:55,704
<i>[Folks say</i> a <i>Gen]! Woman
painted red</i>

257
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,075
<i>Ht a ﬂame in him.</i>

258
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:04,249
No! No!

259
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,516
Aah!

260
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,081
I'll teach you good!

261
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:14,727
I show you what a real man is!

262
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:22,933
I know, I know.

263
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:39,217
So <i>she rah to the hideout
of her own ﬂesh and blood.</i>

264
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:43,690
<i>Was it to protect her son,</i>

265
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:46,160
<i>or get vengeance
for her husband?</i>

266
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,964
How much for the lady'?

267
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,396
How much you got'?

268
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:26,008
Depends on how much
you'll pay me.

269
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:53,119
Keep it in your pants, lily liver.

270
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:57,257
The tougher man gets the girl.

271
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,007
Do what you like.

272
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:14,049
Do her here, upstairs.

273
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:18,247
Wherever and however
you please.

274
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,588
You are the second
cunning wolf

275
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:31,691
I ever really wanted
to draw iron at.

276
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:34,259
Who was the first?

277
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,066
A legend.

278
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:42,038
One I heard
when I was a kid.

279
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:46,372
Oh, yeah?

280
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:54,821
The Bloody..

281
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:01,091
Benten.

282
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:07,068
Bloody Benten.

283
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:14,508
The fighting goddess legend.

284
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:17,045
Shit.

285
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:24,011
Now I really want
to draw iron at you.

286
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,513
Nice.

287
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,581
Ain't refined,

288
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:06,220
but it hits you deep down.

289
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:12,292
The Anasazi play that music.

290
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:17,567
They were here
before any of us.

291
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:22,577
They still keep the old Ways.

292
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:46,526
<i>N'</i>

293
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:08,178
You'll do fine.

294
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:13,188
I want Kiyomori dead.

295
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:22,463
You've thrown away your body,
everything, all for revenge?

296
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,229
So what?

297
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:29,203
Don't pity me.

298
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,241
I don't need useless
compassion from you.

299
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:37,109
Good. It ain't
good for nothing, huh'?

300
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:45,716
Do you want me'?

301
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:50,524
Very much.

302
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,923
But be careful.

303
00:40:55,986 --> 00:41:02,267
Yoshitsunes men left town
to get a powerful weapon.

304
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:04,966
Yoichi wants you dead.

305
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:07,839
They'll likely be here by sunup.

306
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:14,406
When the shooting starts,

307
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:19,319
take Heihachi and
escape to the mountains.

308
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:22,846
You're not gonna run'?

309
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:29,421
Oh, you got something
against them, too'?

310
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,933
I got my reasons.

311
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:23,540
Have the roses
bloomed yet'?

312
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:27,521
What are they named'?

313
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:36,727
Love.

314
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,470
Howdy, Sheriff.

315
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:59,109
"A special Weapon
will be here soon.

316
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:01,087
<i>“Before the Germs get "w,</i>

319
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:11,863
Sorry.

320
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:17,768
What are you doing, boy'?

321
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:20,832
Shit or get off the pot!

322
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,514
Hold your horses.

323
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:37,423
Instead of telling them
the godawful truth,

324
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:40,621
don't you reckon
we better hightail it'?

325
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:49,899
I ain't listening to you no more.

326
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:54,970
Kiyomori!

327
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:56,841
Boss Kiyomori!

328
00:43:58,502 --> 00:43:59,947
Aah!

329
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:03,644
The name's Henry.

330
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:06,153
Where have you been'?

331
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:12,784
I was spying on the Genjis,

332
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:16,423
and things are getting
Way out of hand.

333
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,797
Excuse me.

334
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:21,996
Come again?

335
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,723
Whoa!

336
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:51,631
See-ya! See-ya! See-ya! See-ya!

337
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:52,793
See-ya! See-ya!

338
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:57,566
I told you we shouldve
skipped town.

339
00:44:57,628 --> 00:45:00,438
I told you.

340
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:11,011
Shit. Whoa!

341
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:19,218
Go!

342
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:55,528
Ye-yeah!

343
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:00,297
Fear nothing!

344
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,633
Hah!

345
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:12,003
Whoa!

346
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:54,454
Stupid.

347
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:24,048
You did this.

348
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:39,796
Fire, boys, and guard the Windows.

349
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:38,793
How'd he pull that off'?

350
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:41,387
Come!

351
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:47,534
Ichiro. Matsui.

352
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:55,099
Follow me.

353
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:56,735
What happened'?

354
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,177
Tell you later!

355
00:48:58,235 --> 00:48:59,737
We're going to the old man's
place in the mountains.

356
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:02,340
Heihachi! Heihachi!
Come on, hurry!

357
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:04,113
- Come on!
- This way.

358
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:29,275
Watch your step.

359
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:32,847
Take Heihachi
and go without me.

360
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:34,177
What did you forget'?

361
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:36,274
Something important!

362
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,785
What's Wrong?

363
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:06,141
Forget them!
You don't need them!

364
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,845
No! They're..

365
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:30,827
They're..

366
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:32,396
They're my~

367
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:37,442
heart.

368
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:08,073
No matter what,
one of you's gonna die.

369
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,774
Heihachi. Please.

370
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,786
Please, not him.

371
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:22,187
If you want him to live,

372
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:28,127
drop.. your.. guns.

373
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:44,842
Stop bitching! Hyah!

374
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:04,760
The time is now!

375
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:07,461
Ho!

376
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:36,291
Hey. Hey!

377
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:49,071
Die!

378
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,615
Hmm.

379
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,548
<i>EATunQ</i>

380
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:01,282
Haah!

381
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,627
Aah!

382
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:51,469
Lucky me.

383
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,383
Henry!

384
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:20,020
Aah!

385
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:27,867
Hah! Ho!

386
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:02,161
Henry!

387
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:31,387
Shigemori,

388
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:35,766
I won't die until we win.

389
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:46,606
Uhh.. Uh..

390
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,308
Payback's a bitch!

391
00:56:56,946 --> 00:57:00,120
Before you die..

392
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:07,367
I have something sweet.

393
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:44,663
You want some, bitch'?

394
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:53,411
You are an animal.

395
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:16,930
Toshio!
Throw it here!

396
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:50,497
Can't be..

397
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,040
bloody..

398
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,290
Heihachi.

399
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:21,062
Heihachi.

400
00:59:21,124 --> 00:59:24,594
What are you doing'?

401
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:31,076
Open your eyes.

402
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:32,772
Hmm'?

403
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:34,576
See for yourself.

404
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:40,117
You can't close them
to reality.

405
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:44,520
Open your eyes!

406
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,721
Heihachi! Heihachi!

407
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:51,459
Open your eyes!

408
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,312
Aah!

409
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:36,309
Could you
visit this address

410
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:40,439
and stock up on these?

411
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:44,451
If he is still alive,

412
01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:49,479
my signature here
should help you out.

413
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:53,319
I wish I could go,

414
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:55,727
but I can't
leave the boy alone.

415
01:00:55,785 --> 01:00:56,729
Ruriko.

416
01:00:56,786 --> 01:00:58,527
Hmm'?

417
01:00:58,588 --> 01:01:03,264
But these are guns.

418
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:06,466
Tell him I need help,

419
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:10,102
and he owes me.

420
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:13,875
You are the only one
I can depend on.

421
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:50,748
What's "BB"?

422
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:55,256
When this doubly
talented goddess

423
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:58,224
used to play music.

424
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:01,626
She would hold
her instruments
in both hands.

425
01:02:01,684 --> 01:02:05,723
But when she was
on the Warpath,

426
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:09,565
she held Weapons
in eight hands.

427
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:21,742
When the fire of vengeance dvvelled in her
eyes,

428
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:25,513
this murdering goddess
was Wide awake,

429
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:29,819
and everything in her Way
got stained blood red.

430
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:40,296
They dubbed her
Bloody Benten.

431
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:50,103
Nicknamed double B for short.

432
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:53,804
I was the one who
educated her in killing,

433
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:56,282
and it was tough going.

434
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:01,348
You like it'?

435
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:06,691
It's too sweet.

436
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:09,457
Well..
Too much sugar.

437
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:12,432
This is sukiyaki,
not a damn lollipop!

438
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:15,594
Oh, I'm so sorry.

439
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:20,164
How many times
do I gotta tell you

440
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:24,041
before it sinks into
that thick skull of yours

441
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:28,515
that you draw
the sweetness out of
the Chinese cabbage?

442
01:03:28,571 --> 01:03:31,552
Sorry..
And this tofu.

443
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:33,848
It's kinugoshi!

444
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:38,381
But-But..
But the store was sold out.

445
01:03:38,447 --> 01:03:39,755
Aah!

446
01:03:40,883 --> 01:03:46,356
No.. damn.. darned excuses!

447
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:47,366
I'm sorry.

448
01:03:47,423 --> 01:03:49,300
Dang useless woman.

449
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:53,363
Why I ever thought
I could make
a gunfighter out of..

450
01:04:08,211 --> 01:04:09,952
Listen up, girl.

451
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:12,583
If this were a gunfight,

452
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:15,595
you wouldn't be saying
"They sold out of bullets,

453
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:18,598
let's shoot beans instead,"
now could ya'?

454
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:22,864
That'd mean death
to me and you, wouldn't it'?
Hmm, wouldn't it'?

455
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:27,200
That's my girl.
There you go.

456
01:04:27,263 --> 01:04:28,901
Never let
your guard down.

457
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:30,376
Yes.

458
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:32,811
The Grim Reaper himself
dwells in that pot.

459
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,042
Don't you forget that.

460
01:04:37,473 --> 01:04:41,785
I.. I nev..

461
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:44,688
Sugar.

462
01:04:48,784 --> 01:04:50,764
Don't worry.

463
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:54,495
The sugar helps me.

464
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:57,633
Lordy lord.

465
01:04:57,693 --> 01:05:00,173
You ain't pregnant,
is ya'?

466
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:09,511
I reckon it will be
a bouncing boy.

467
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:17,558
Oh, heck.

468
01:05:18,814 --> 01:05:22,523
You mean Akira'?

469
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,064
Akira.

470
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:27,329
How the lovely sound

471
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:31,566
of that name
brings me back.

472
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:33,607
What can I say'?

473
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:38,669
At the end, I am
an anime otaku at heart.

474
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:40,611
What?

475
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:48,681
How's my boy'?

476
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:03,904
Ah, so.

477
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:13,277
That's Why you've come
for them irons, eh'?

478
01:06:16,605 --> 01:06:21,782
You'll tell her this for me.

479
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:48,881
Life is all about goodbyes.

480
01:06:59,982 --> 01:07:04,124
We are in your hands!

481
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:51,840
I'm surprised.

482
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,040
He is still alive.

483
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:59,650
I guess

484
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:03,383
every man's got his own reasons

485
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:07,826
for Why he has to keep on living.

486
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:22,956
Got a cold?

487
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:26,090
Don't you have one, too'?

488
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:55,724
Thank you.

489
01:11:00,122 --> 01:11:01,533
You going'?

490
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:03,263
Huh?

491
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:05,965
Yep.

492
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:09,202
Going. Where to'?

493
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:13,605
To settle a score.

494
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:16,650
What score'?

495
01:11:16,705 --> 01:11:19,379
The town's got nothing
to do with you.

496
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:21,011
Shit just happens.

497
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:24,285
That's all.

498
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:30,858
So the meaning of life
is shit happens, huh'?

499
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:35,129
Well, I don't want to run
from the shit anymore.

500
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:38,000
Sorry, but could you
fetch the treasure for me'?

501
01:11:41,563 --> 01:11:43,201
There is one'?

502
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:48,976
Ruriko,
what about the town law'?

503
01:11:49,038 --> 01:11:54,078
As anyone who's getting on
in years around here knows..

504
01:11:56,245 --> 01:11:59,192
he was chosen to guard it.

505
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:02,661
That's the town law.

506
01:12:02,718 --> 01:12:06,461
I thought Heihachi
would be the next chosen one,

507
01:12:06,522 --> 01:12:09,059
but he's too weak.

508
01:12:09,124 --> 01:12:14,472
I reckon he was born at the wrong time
and in the wrong place.

509
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:18,205
He does have a gift
for music, though.

510
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:23,182
But tenderness alone
Won't get you far in life.

511
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:26,276
What are you fixing to do
with the treasure?

512
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:30,290
Settle this
once and for all.

513
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:32,326
If we lose,
they can have it.

514
01:12:32,381 --> 01:12:37,057
If we win,
you can have half.

515
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:40,657
How about it'? You game'?

516
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:44,398
Suits me fine.

517
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,030
Okay, then.

518
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:56,046
This way.

519
01:13:02,111 --> 01:13:05,490
No. This way.

520
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:12,894
I ain't gonna listen to you no more!

521
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,101
That's my line!

522
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:22,972
I'll kill you!

523
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:30,982
Aah!

524
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:38,486
Smells like victory.

525
01:13:38,547 --> 01:13:42,552
Got the Mr. Gatling riding shotgun.

526
01:13:42,618 --> 01:13:47,158
And now, a shield.

527
01:13:47,222 --> 01:13:49,998
A shield'?

528
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:55,098
If you were fatter, it would be perfect.

529
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:01,110
Hey! Hey!

530
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:03,377
Hey, hold on!

531
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:07,114
Come on, now! Hey! No! No!

532
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:14,923
Shit.

533
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:19,363
Hey, if I get taken down,

534
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:21,992
will you give this
to Heihachi for me'?

535
01:14:22,057 --> 01:14:26,005
I'll think about it
if and when you die.

536
01:14:26,061 --> 01:14:28,132
Hey! Hey!

537
01:14:30,065 --> 01:14:32,545
I'll carry the treasure for you.

538
01:14:32,601 --> 01:14:33,773
I'll carry the guns.

539
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:35,975
And if there's
any more carrying to do,

540
01:14:36,038 --> 01:14:38,450
then let me do it.

541
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:44,458
Well, if you ain't the most stubborn
man I ever did meet.

542
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:47,957
Let him take it.

543
01:14:48,016 --> 01:14:51,987
A man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do.

544
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:04,206
Go, Banjo. Go!

545
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:11,476
We get shot,

546
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:13,747
and you are the one's
gonna get smoked,

547
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:16,085
not me.

548
01:15:16,144 --> 01:15:18,590
You die first.

549
01:15:18,647 --> 01:15:21,457
No, you die first!

550
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:24,755
We die.

551
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:26,663
Okay, we die.

552
01:15:26,722 --> 01:15:29,202
We die. I die.

553
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:32,705
You die, he dies, she dies, we die.

554
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:34,866
Everybody dies.

555
01:16:03,859 --> 01:16:07,932
Here's the treasure!

556
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:12,640
Have at it, boys!

557
01:16:12,701 --> 01:16:16,478
Winner takes all!

558
01:16:20,108 --> 01:16:22,611
Hey! Look!

559
01:16:22,678 --> 01:16:25,158
Gold! Gold!

560
01:16:58,747 --> 01:17:00,351
Spread out!

561
01:17:00,415 --> 01:17:01,860
- Here!
- This way!

562
01:17:31,213 --> 01:17:32,214
This way.

563
01:18:17,926 --> 01:18:21,203
<i>Where those Hake boys'?</i>

564
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:44,960
No! No!

565
01:18:47,789 --> 01:18:49,598
No!

566
01:18:49,658 --> 01:18:52,161
Get down!

567
01:19:10,145 --> 01:19:12,352
You've got a new toy.

568
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:15,156
Shields!

569
01:19:20,856 --> 01:19:21,960
Aah!

570
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:38,918
Yoshitsune!

571
01:20:19,881 --> 01:20:23,055
Confess thy error!

572
01:20:36,531 --> 01:20:39,512
This time, we win.

573
01:21:32,287 --> 01:21:35,461
This time, we win!

574
01:21:35,523 --> 01:21:37,366
Ha ha ha ha!

575
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,640
This time..

576
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:19,608
That's for the mayor.

577
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:28,345
I can.

578
01:22:34,015 --> 01:22:36,188
I win.

579
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:38,356
I win.

580
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:59,282
I ain't dead..

581
01:22:59,341 --> 01:23:02,413
till I beat you.

582
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:07,726
This is for Akira.

583
01:23:29,704 --> 01:23:31,980
It's all mine!

584
01:23:45,553 --> 01:23:48,090
It's mine.

585
01:23:58,366 --> 01:24:00,642
It's all ours!

586
01:24:48,483 --> 01:24:49,894
I§§

587
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:52,959
always..

588
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:55,600
you're..

589
01:24:55,657 --> 01:24:57,568
Don't say it.

590
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:09,876
No one in the world
ever saved Benten's life.

591
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:15,546
Except for you.

592
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:20,855
Nope.

593
01:25:24,385 --> 01:25:25,523
You..

594
01:25:27,088 --> 01:25:31,093
You're Ruriko.

595
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:33,833
My..

596
01:25:33,895 --> 01:25:38,571
Ruriko.

597
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:19,614
I'm not..

598
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:21,551
dead..

599
01:26:24,345 --> 01:26:26,552
Vet.

600
01:28:03,778 --> 01:28:07,157
Now this..

601
01:28:10,418 --> 01:28:13,422
Is what I call class.

602
01:28:23,765 --> 01:28:29,511
So that old granny
was Bloody Benten, eh'?

603
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:34,984
I'm glad I came here.

604
01:28:35,043 --> 01:28:39,014
Hell, I'm glad I was born.

605
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:43,028
Finally, with a worthy opponent,

606
01:28:43,084 --> 01:28:47,055
I can risk my life to the death.

607
01:29:22,056 --> 01:29:23,660
Victory..

608
01:29:25,493 --> 01:29:26,972
or death!

609
01:31:46,434 --> 01:31:49,711
That's plenty for me.

610
01:31:49,770 --> 01:31:52,910
You keep the rest.

611
01:31:55,409 --> 01:31:58,447
Just do me one thing.

612
01:31:58,513 --> 01:32:00,925
Tend to the roses for me.

613
01:32:07,722 --> 01:32:10,430
But when it doesn't feel right,

614
01:32:10,491 --> 01:32:14,405
you can stop.

615
01:32:14,462 --> 01:32:16,840
Now you've got money,

616
01:32:16,898 --> 01:32:20,937
you've got a gun,

617
01:32:21,002 --> 01:32:24,142
and the roses, too.

618
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:29,852
Heihachi,

619
01:32:29,911 --> 01:32:31,322
son,

620
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:37,761
no matter what the times may be,

621
01:32:37,818 --> 01:32:40,526
no matter Where you are,

622
01:32:40,588 --> 01:32:46,368
what matters is you
and how you deal with this world.

623
01:32:48,796 --> 01:32:54,508
And there ain't no running from it.

624
01:33:05,479 --> 01:33:06,856
Don't run.

625
01:33:08,849 --> 01:33:11,295
Decide for yourself

626
01:33:11,352 --> 01:33:13,229
what tomorrow's gonna be.

627
01:34:30,731 --> 01:34:32,938
Love.

628
01:34:40,174 --> 01:34:44,714
Your mother was a mighty fine lady.

629
01:35:21,101 --> 01:35:35,301
